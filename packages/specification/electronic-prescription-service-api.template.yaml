    ## Overview
    <style>.codeinline.example {word-wrap: anywhere;}</style>
    Use this API to access the [Electronic Prescription Service (EPS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/electronic-prescription-service). EPS is the national service used to send electronic prescription messages between prescribers and community dispensers.

    If you are using this API in [user-restricted mode](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis) a healthcare worker must be present and authenticated with an [NHS smartcard or a modern alternative](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers) to use this API.

    ### Prescribers in primary and secondary care can: 
    * create a prescription
    * encode data so the prescription is ready to sign
    * cancel a prescription

    Creating and cancelling a prescription are both done by the prescriber. Encoding data so the prescription is ready to sign is done by the prescribing system.

    ### Dispensers can:
    * download an individual prescription from EPS
    * download a batch of prescriptions from EPS
    * return a prescription to EPS
    * submit a dispense notification to EPS
    * withdraw a dispense notification from EPS
    * submit a dispense claim

    You cannot currently use this API to:
    * view a prescription's detailed dispense history

    ## Who can use this API
      This API can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. Make sure you have a [valid use case](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/electronic-prescription-service/enabling-eps-for-your-service) before you go too far with your development. 

    You must get approval before you can go live. For more information, see the 'Onboarding' section.

    ## Related APIs, services and documentation
       
    ### Services
    These services must be used alongside EPS to create a functioning prescribing or dispensing system.
    * [Care Identity Service 2 (CIS2)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/identity-and-access-management/national-care-identity-service) - use this to authenticate prescribers with their smartcard.
    * [Directory of Services (DOS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/directory-of-services-dos) - prescribers must use the DOS to find dispensing sites for patients.
    * [Organisation Data Service (ODS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/organisation-data-service-fhir) - use this to access ODS codes for prescribing organisations.
    * [Personal Demographics Service (PDS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-fhir) - use PDS to synchronise a patient's demographic details including their name, date of birth and address.
    * [Digital Signature Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/signing-service) - use the signing service API to create signatures for prescriptions. The signing service is only used for EPS.
    * [Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC)](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/national-rbac-for-developers) - RBAC rules are stored in the National RBAC Database (NRD) and are used to limit what prescribers can and cannot do.
    * [GP2GP](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/gp2gp) - use the GP2GP service to transfer patient details, including nominated dispensers, between GPs.
    * [Message Exchange for Social Care and Health (MESH)](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-api) - Use MESH to deliver and receive cancel responses.
    * [Prescription Tracker](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/eps-tracker) - use this if you want a read-only interface to get information about a patient's prescriptions.
    * [Real-Time Exemption Checking](https://nhsconnect.github.io/prescription-exemptions/) - dispensing systems must use the Real-Time Exemption Checking service to prevent prescriptions fraud and enable effective processing of charge exemptions.

    ### Documentation
    This documentation provides important context
    * [Dictionary of Medicines and Devices (DM+D)](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pharmacies-gp-practices-and-appliance-contractors/dictionary-medicines-and-devices-dmd) - the dm+d has the names, descriptions and unique identifiers for medicines and devices that can be prescribed.
    * [Requirements and Guidance for Endorsement in the Electronic Prescription Service (EPS)](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/sites/default/files/2023-03/NHSBSAGuidanceforEndorsement_v8.0.pdf) - guidance on handling prescription types, prescription endorsements, and patient charge exemptions within EPS.

    ### Guidance for developers and product owners
    Documentation and guidance about EPS for technical and non-technical audiences
    * [Simplifier implementation guide for digital medicines](https://simplifier.net/guide/ukcoreimplementationguideformedicines?version=current) - the implementation guide contains detailed information and example messages, error codes and processes. This is for technical audiences like developers.
    * [Building healthcare software - prescriptions](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/building-healthcare-software/prescriptions) - this explains how to build software that deals with prescriptions. This is for non-technical audiences like product owners.

    ## API status and roadmap
    The immediate priority of EPS development is to support the rollout of the next-gen FHIR APIs for primary care and secondary care prescribing and dispensing.

    ### Prescribing
    The API supports prescribers in primary and secondary care settings. This means prescriptions are sent from a GP or NHS hospital to a pharmacy. For these workflows, the API is [in production](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses).
    * it is available in integration and production
    * we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we will give advance notice

    ### Dispensing
    This API supports a community pharmacy dispensing workflow.

    In a community pharmacy workflow, prescriptions can be released (downloaded) from EPS, updated, dispensed, and then claimed by the pharmacy. For this workflow, the API is [in production](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses).
    - it is available in integration and production
    - we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we will give advance notice

    ### Roadmap
    To see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?tag=eps-fhir-api).

    If you have any other queries, please [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).

    ## Service level
    This API is a platinum service, meaning it is operational and supported 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

    For more details, see [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).

    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).

    It conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange, specifically to [FHIR R4 (v4.0.1)](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/), except that it does not support the [capabilities](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities) interaction.

    It includes some country-specific FHIR extensions, which are built against [FHIR UK Core, specifically [UKcore.stu1 0.5.1](https://simplifier.net/packages/fhir.r4.ukcore.stu1/0.5.1).

    You do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules. In particular:
    * resource names are capitalised and singular, for example `/Patient` not `/patients`
    * array names are singular, for example `line` not `lines` for address lines
    * data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object

    There are [libraries and software development kits available](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks) to help with FHIR API integration.

    ## Network access
    This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).
    To use this API with [NHS smartcards](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers), the end user needs an HSCN connection, although internet-facing alternatives to smartcards are available.

    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).

    ## Security and authorisation
    This API has 2 access modes:
    * user-restricted access
    * application-restricted access

    ### User-restricted access
    The EPS APIs are mostly [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis),
    meaning we authenticate the end user.

    EPS only supports [CIS2 separate authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-cis2-separate-authentication-and-authorisation),
    do not use combined authentication and authorisation.

    The only interaction that is not user-restricted is releasing nominated prescriptions.

    ### Application-restricted access
    Use this access mode to release nominated prescriptions while dispensing. 

    To use this access mode, use the following security pattern:
    * [Application-restricted RESTful API - signed JWT authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-signed-jwt-authentication)

    ## Environment and testing
    | Environment      | Base URL                                                            |

    | Production       | `https://api.service.nhs.uk/electronic-prescriptions`               |

    ### Sandbox testing
    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):

    * is for early developer testing
    * only covers a limited set of scenarios
    * is stateless, so it does not actually persist any updates
    * is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation

    For details of sandbox testing, or to try out the sandbox using our "Try this API" feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.

    ### Integration testing
    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):

    * is for formal integration testing
    * is stateful, so persists updates
    * includes authorisation, with [smartcard](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers) and non-smartcard options

    For more details see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).

    ## Onboarding
    Your software must be approved by us before you can begin the EPS onboarding process and go live with this FHIR API. EPS 'onboarding' is the term used for the development and assurance required before IT suppliers can offer EPS to NHS organisations.

    Details of the onboarding process can be found on our [EPS onboarding and assurance for IT suppliers](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/electronic-prescription-service/guidance-for-developers/onboarding-and-assurance) page.

    ## Resources
    Use the [Digital Medicines Implementation Guide](https://simplifier.net/guide/NHSDigital-Medicines) to assist with your integration.
    This is the FHIR specification for Digital Medicines starting with the assets required for an electronic prescription sent to the EPS.

    For further guidance on prescribing, see [EPS prescribing developer guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/building-healthcare-software/prescriptions/eps-prescriber-developer-guide).
