    ## Overview

    <style>.codeinline.example {word-wrap: anywhere;}</style>

    Use this API to access the [Electronic Prescription Service (EPS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/electronic-prescription-service). EPS is the national service used to send electronic prescription messages between prescribers and community dispensers.


    ### Prescribers in primary and secondary care can: 

    * create a prescription

    * encode data so the prescription is ready to sign

    * cancel a prescription


    Creating and cancelling a prescription are both done by the prescriber. Encoding data so the prescription is ready to sign is done by the prescribing system.


    ### Dispensers can:

    * download an individual prescription from EPS

    * download a batch of prescriptions from EPS

    * return a prescription to EPS

    * submit a dispense notification to EPS

    * withdraw a dispense notification from EPS

    * submit a dispense claim


    You cannot currently use this API to:

    * view a prescription's detailed dispense history


    ## Who can use this API
      This API can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so. Make sure you have a [valid use case](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/electronic-prescription-service/enabling-eps-for-your-service) before you go too far with your development. 

    You must get approval before you can go live. For more information, see the 'Onboarding' section.


    ## Related APIs, services and documentation
       
    ### Services

    These services must be used to create a functioning system using EPS that meets assurance standards. 

    * [Care Identity Serice 2 (CIS2)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/identity-and-access-management/national-care-identity-service) - use this to authenticate prescribers with their smartcard.

    * [Directory of Services (DOS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/directory-of-services-dos) - prescribers must use the DOS to find dispensing sites for patients.

    * [Organisation Data Service (ODS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/organisation-data-service-fhir) - use this to access ODS codes for prescribing organisations.

    * [Personal Demographics Service (PDS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-fhir) - use PDS to synchronise a patient's demographic details including their name, date of birth and address.

    * [Signing Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/signing-service) - use the signing service API to create signatures for prescriptions. The signing service is only used for EPS.

    * [Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC)](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/national-rbac-for-developers) - RBAC rules are stored in the National RBAC Database (NRD) and are used to limit what prescribers can and cannot do.

    * [GP2GP](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/gp2gp) - use the GP2GP service to transfer patient details, including nominated dispensers, between GPs.

    * [Message Exchange for Social Care and Health (MESH)](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/message-exchange-for-social-care-and-health-api) - Use MESH to deliver and receive cancel responses.

    * [Prescription Tracker](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/eps-tracker) - use this if you want a read-only interface to get information about a patient's prescriptions.


    ### Documentation

    This documentation must be used in the API to meet assurance requirements when integrating with EPS.

    * [Dictionary of Medicines and Devices (DM+D)](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pharmacies-gp-practices-and-appliance-contractors/dictionary-medicines-and-devices-dmd) - the DM+D has the names, descriptions and unique identifiers for medicines and devices that can be prescribed.

    * [Business Servies Authority (BSA)](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/) - the BSA website has guidance and codes for endorsements and prescription types for reimbursement.


    ### Guidance for developers and product owners

    Documentation and guidance about EPS for technical and non-technical audiences

    * [Simplifier implementation guide for digital medicines](https://simplifier.net/guide/ukcoreimplementationguideformedicines?version=current) - the implementation guide contains detailed information and example messages, error codes and processes. This is for technical audiences like developers.

    * [Building healhtcare software - prescriptions](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/building-healthcare-software/prescriptions) - this explains how to build software that deals with presriptions. This is for non-technical audiences like product owners.


    ## API status and roadmap

    The immediate priority of EPS development is to support the rollout of the next-gen FHIR APIs for primary care and secondary care prescribing and dispensing.


    ### Prescribing

    The API supports prescribers in primary and secondary care settings. This means prescriptions are sent from a GP or NHS hospital to a pharmacy. For these workflows, the API is in [in production, beta](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses), meaning:

    * it is available in integration and production

    * we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we will give advance notice


    ### Dispensing

    This API supports a community pharmacy dispensing workflow.


    In a community pharmacy workflow, prescriptions can be released (downloaded) from EPS, updated, dispensed, and then claimed by the pharmacy. For this workflow, the API is in [in development](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses), meaning:

    - it is available for testing in the integration environment, but not for production use

    - we might make breaking changes, but only if we cannot avoid it, and we will give advance notice


    ### Roadmap

    To see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?tag=eps-fhir-api).


    If you have any other queries, please [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).


    ## Service level

    This API is a platinum service, meaning it is operational and supported 24x7x365.


    For more details, see [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).


    ## Technology

    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).


    It conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange, specifically to [FHIR R4 (v4.0.1)](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/), except that it does not support the [capabilities](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities) interaction.


    It includes some country-specific FHIR extensions, which are built against [FHIR UK Core, specifically [UKcore.stu1 0.5.1](https://simplifier.net/packages/fhir.r4.ukcore.stu1/0.5.1).


    You do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules. In particular:

    * resource names are capitalised and singular, for example `/Patient` not `/patients`

    * array names are singular, for example `line` not `lines` for address lines

    * data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object


    There are [libraries and software development kits available](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks) to help with FHIR API integration.


    ## Network access

    This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).

    To use this API with [NHS smartcards](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers), the end user needs an HSCN connection, although internet-facing alternatives to smartcards are available.


    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).


    ## Security and authorisation

    This API has 2 access modes:

    * user-restricted access

    * application-restricted access


    ### User-restricted access

    The EPS APIs are mostly [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis),

    meaning we authenticate the end user.


    EPS only supports [CIS2 separate authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-cis2-separate-authentication-and-authorisation),

    do not use combined authentication and authorisation.


    The only interaction that is not user-restricted is releasing nominated prescriptions.


    ### Application-restricted access

    Use this access mode to release nominated prescriptions while dispensing. 


    To use this access mode, use the following security pattern:

    * [Application-restricted RESTful API - signed JWT authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-signed-jwt-authentication)


    ## Environment and testing

    ### Sandbox testing

    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):


    * is for early developer testing

    * only covers a limited set of scenarios

    * is stateless, so it does not actually persist any updates

    * is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation


    For details of sandbox testing, or to try out the sandbox using our "Try this API" feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.


    ### Integration testing

    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):


    * is for formal integration testing

    * is stateful, so persists updates

    * includes authorisation, with [smartcard](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/nhs-smartcards-for-developers) and non-smartcard options


    For more details see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).


    ## Onboarding

    You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding.

    The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it’s worth planning well ahead.


    To begin the onboarding process please download and complete the [EPS use case form](https://nhs-prod.global.ssl.fastly.net/binaries/content/assets/website-assets/developer/electronic-prescription-service-fhir-api/eps-access-form-v1.0-org-short-name-yyyymmdd-1.docx) and email it to us at [epsonboarding@nhs.net](mailto:epsonboarding@nhs.net).


    ## Resources

    Use the [Digital Medicines Implementation Guide](https://simplifier.net/guide/NHSDigital-Medicines) to assist with your integration.

    This is the FHIR specification for Digital Medicines starting with the assets required for an electronic prescription sent to the EPS.


    For further guidance on prescribing, see [EPS prescribing developer guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/building-healthcare-software/prescriptions/eps-prescriber-developer-guide).

                                  It is the administrative gender that the patient wishes to be known as. In some cases, this may not be the same as the patient’s registered birth gender, or their current clinical gender.

                                  It is a date in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`. Due to data quality issues on a small number of patients `yyyy-mm` and `yyyy` format may also be returned.


                                  When a patient tagged as `very restricted` is retrieved, birth date is removed from the response.

                                        Purpose of this address:
                                          * `home` - the home address is the patient's normal residence. Home address is also known as usual, main, registered, current or permanent address
                                          * `temp` - a temporary address is an address used for a set period of time, but where the patient's home, permanent address remains unchanged
                                          * `billing` - an address used for correspondence purposes only
                                          * `work` - an office address. This can be returned due to legacy data but cannot be added or replaced on update

                                          A patient should have no more than one current `temp` and/or `billing` address.
                                          However, historically this was constrained only by the integration requirements and was not enforced so theoretically more than one can exist for a patient when retrieving.
                                          Where multiple instances already exist for the patient it is not expected that local systems should manage those, but should choose the most appropriate one to maintain (e.g. by examining period dates).

                                          A `home` address is the patient's main residential address and should normally be used for all clinical and demographic purposes, including clinical and appointment correspondence.
                                          However additionally, `temp` and `billing` addresses may be provided by a patient when there is a requirement to record an alternative location for the purposes of unbroken care.
                                          When sending correspondence to a patient:
                                          *  a present and valid `billing` address may take precedence over `home` and `temp` addresses. A patient should have only a single current `billing` address. An address is considered 'valid' according to its period start and end dates.
                                          *  if no current `billing` address is provided, a `temp` address may take precedence over the `home` address, again if it is valid according to its period start and end dates.
                                          * if there is no valid, current `billing` and/or `temp` address, the `home` address must be used.

      description: >
        ## Overview

        Use this endpoint to create a new prescription in EPS.


        The prescription must include a digital signature, which can be generated using the [Signing Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/signing-service).


        The `#prescription-order` in the URL has been added to distinguish this from the other operations which

        can be performed using the [`$process-message` endpoint](https://simplifier.net/guide/NHSDigital/Home/FHIRAssets/AllAssets/OperationDefinition/process-message). It is not required in requests to the API.

      summary: Cancel a prescription - Prescribing
      description: >
        ## Overview

        Use this endpoint to cancel a prescription.


        The effect of calling this endpoint depends on the type of the message, which is determined by the `MessageHeader` resource.

        To cancel a prescription, send a [prescription-order-update message](https://simplifier.net/guide/NHSDigital-Medicines/Home/FHIRAssets/AllAssets/MessageDefinition-duplicate-2/prescription-order-update).


        The `#prescription-order-update` in the URL has been added to distinguish this from the other operations which

        can be performed using the [`$process-message` endpoint](https://simplifier.net/guide/NHSDigital/Home/FHIRAssets/AllAssets/OperationDefinition/process-message). It is not required in requests to the API.

      summary: Return a downloaded prescription - Dispensing
      description: >
        ## Overview

        Use this endpoint to return a downloaded prescription to EPS, so that another dispensing system can download it.


        The effect of calling this endpoint depends on the Task status.

        To return a downloaded prescription to EPS, send a Task with a status of `rejected`.

        For more information on how to create these messages, see [NHSDigital-Task](https://simplifier.net/guide/NHSDigital-Medicines/Home/FHIRAssets/AllAssets/Profiles/NHSDigital-Task).


        Note that the `#return` in the URL has been added to distinguish this from the other operations which

        can be performed using the `Task` endpoint. It is not required in requests to the API.

      description: >
        ## Overview

        ### Dispense notification

        Use this endpoint to send a dispense notification to EPS.


        The effect of calling this endpoint depends on the type of the message, which is determined by the `MessageHeader` resource.

        To mark a prescription as partially or fully dispensed, send a [dispense-notification message](https://simplifier.net/guide/NHSDigital-Medicines/Home/FHIRAssets/AllAssets/MessageDefinition-duplicate-2/dispense-notification).


        Note that the `#dispense-notification` in the URL has been added to distinguish this from the other operations which

        can be performed using the [`$process-message` endpoint](https://simplifier.net/guide/NHSDigital/Home/FHIRAssets/AllAssets/OperationDefinition/process-message). It is not required in requests to the API.


        ### Amend dispense notification

        The same endpoint can be used to amend a previous dispense notification. The same message structure is used with the addition of a `replacementOf` extension in the MessageHeader,

        referencing the identifier of the previous dispense notifcation to be amended. Only the most recent dispense notification can be amended. To amend other dispense notifications please use the Withdraw endpoint, to withdraw all dispense notifications issued after the amend target, and then amend if necessary.


        More information can be found on the fhir [documentation](https://simplifier.net/guide/NHSDigital/Home/FHIRAssets/AllAssets/Profiles/NHSDigital-MessageHeader).

                If amending a previous dispense notification, include the `replacementOf` extension.

      summary: Withdraw a dispense notification - Dispensing
      description: >
        ## Overview

        Use this endpoint to withdraw a dispense notification, for example in the case that a prescription was marked as dispensed erroneously.


        The effect of calling this endpoint depends on the Task status.

        To withdraw a dispense notification from EPS, send a Task with a status of `in-progress`.

        For more information on how to create these messages, see [NHSDigital-Task](https://simplifier.net/guide/NHSDigital-Medicines/Home/FHIRAssets/AllAssets/Profiles/NHSDigital-Task).


        Note that the `#withdraw` in the URL has been added to distinguish this from the other operations which

        can be performed using the `Task` endpoint. It is not required in requests to the API.


        This interaction is only available in the sandbox environment.
