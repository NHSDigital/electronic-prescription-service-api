  A MedicationRequest object is required. An EPS prescription must contain at least one and up to four MedicationRequest objects. This is equivalent to an item on a prescription.
  Any fields mentioned in the Simplifer Spec but not in this schema are permitted, but may not be preserved or acted on by the API. 
  Reason for medication dispense should be appended to dosageInstruction.text, as reasonCode is not made available to dispensers.
